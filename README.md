## Ecoimages - add species data to the metadata of the published image

The images were published with the species data, based the published CSV file.
The code used to add the species information to the XMP metadata of the image, in included in the jupyter notebook `add_species_to_image.ipynb`

This code has been setup to run against the photo in the `photos` folder, resulting in a new, enhanced, image with the inclusion of the species information.
